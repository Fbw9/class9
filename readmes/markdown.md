#### What's Markdown?

Markdown is a **lightweight markup language** that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. Created by John Gruber in 2004, Markdown is now one of the world's most popular markup languages.

In an application like Microsoft Word, you click buttons to format words and phrases, and the changes are visible immediately. Markdown isn’t like that. When you create a Markdown-formatted file, you add Markdown syntax to the text to indicate which words and phrases should look different.

For instance, to denote a heading, you add a number sign before it (e.g., \# Heading One). Or to make a phrase bold, you add two asterisks before and after it (e.g., \**this text is bold**). It may take a while to get used to seeing Markdown syntax in your text, especially if you’re accustomed to WYSIWYG applications.

You can add Markdown formatting elements to a plaintext file using a text editor application.

#### How Does it Work?

When you write in Markdown, the text is stored in a plaintext file that has an **.md** or **.markdown** extension. 
But then what? How is your Markdown-formatted file converted into HTML or a print-ready document?

The short answer is that you need a Markdown application capable of processing the Markdown file. 
There are lots of applications available — everything from simple scripts to desktop applications that 
look like Microsoft Word. Despite their visual differences, all of the applications do the same thing, 
they all convert Markdown-formatted text to HTML so it can be displayed in web browsers.

Markdown applications use something called a Markdown processor (also commonly referred to as a “parser” or an 
“implementation”) to take the Markdown-formatted text and output it to HTML format. At that point, 
your document can be viewed in a web browser or combined with a style sheet and printed.
