/* The Restaurant App
Never forget the food at your favorite restaurant!

Create an object to hold information on your favorite restaurant.
It should have properties for name (a string), opening time (a number),
closing time (a number) and entrees (an array of strings).

On your html page, log the restaurant information so it looks like:
Oases
Opens: 2 pm
Closes: 10 pm
Entrees:
Falafel
Hummus
Pizza
Schwarma in Wrap

BONUS: Add a "Order Delivery!" button below the information. When clicked,
it should reveal additional text below it that says "Delivery not available
at this time - Go to sleep" if current time is outside of the time parameters.
If the restaurant is open, it should reveal "Delivery on its way!" */


/* The Reading List

Keep track of which books you read and which books you want to read!

Create an array of objects, where each object describes a book and has
properties for the title (a string), author (a string), and alreadyRead
(a boolean indicating if you read it yet).

Iterate through the array of books. For each book, log the book title
and book author like so: "The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien".

Now use an if/else statement to change the output depending on whether
you read it yet or not. If you read it, log a string like 'You already
read "The Hobbit" by J.R.R. Tolkien', and if not, log a string like 'You
still need to read "The Lord of the Rings" by J.R.R. Tolkien.'
