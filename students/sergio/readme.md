I read this interesting quote the other day:

>_"Her eyes had called him and his soul had leaped at the call. To live, to err, to fall, to triumph, to recreate life out of life!"_

>***"Her eyes had called him and his soul had leaped at the call. To live, to err, to fall, to triumph, to recreate life out of life!"***  

>Once upon a time and a very good time it was there was a moocow coming down along the road and this moocow that was coming down along the road met a nicens little boy named baby tuckoo...
>
>His father told him that story: his father looked at him through a glass: he had a hairy face.
>
>He was baby tuckoo. The moocow came down the road where Betty Byrne lived: she sold lemon platt.
