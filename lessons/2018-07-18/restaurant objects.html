// Pick one of your favorite restaurants in Berlin and create an object with the variable name - restaurant


// Fill it with data ( key value pairs that don't have to be exact). Make sure to include keys: name, seatingCapacity, hasSpecial, and entrees using different data types as values.

// Now practice accessing properties and printing them to the console. Print the entrees using dot notation

// Now print the seating capacity using dot notation


// Print the entrees again using bracket notation hint: ['']


// Print the seating capacity again using bracket notation


// Let's make another object to illustrate one advantage of using bracket over dot notation. Start by creating a new object called dailySpecials and write out the keys breakfast, lunch, and dinner. The values should be statements about the specials (i.e. "15% off breakfast").

//Now create a conditional statement that equates the word meal to each one of your keys depending on the time of day

//Make a variable called time. Use bracket notation to pull to display the current special.



// Does it work with dot notation? Try it out!


// Let's go back to our restaurants object and add appetizers and desserts to it using two different methods


// The food items have changed a bit because it is now summer! Use the same methods used to add an item, to edit some of the items in your entree, appetizer, and desserts


// Let's now create methods that just print out a string when the restaurant opens or closes. Create a method called openRestaurant and closeRestaurant inside of the restaurant object

//Now call on these two methods


// Let's practice using the 'this' keyword. Create another restaurant object.

// Add a key to your restaurants object called restaurantOnFire and set the boolean to false (hopefully by default there is no fire!)


// Show the other way of using this - adds flexibility and allows the method to be used in other objects


// Finally let's do some while/for loops on our restaurants to print out the entrees
