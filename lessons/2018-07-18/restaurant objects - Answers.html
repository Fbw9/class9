// Pick one of your favorite restaurants in Berlin and create an object with the variable name - restaurant

// Fill it with data ( key value pairs that don't have to be exact). Make sure to include keys: name, seatingCapacity, hasSpecial, and entrees using different data types as values.
let restaurantOne = {
  name: "Burger King",
  seatingCapacity: 300,
  hasSpecial: true,
  mainDishes: ["Plastic burger", "Paper burger", "Chicken Strips"],
  openRestaurant() {
    return "WE ARE OPEN!!!!";
  },
  closeRestaurant() {
    return "BK is CLOSED FOREVER";
  }
}

let time = 16;

let dailySpecials = {
  breakfast: "15% off plastic breakfast sandwiches",
  lunch: "2 for 1 chicken strips",
  dinner: "5 for 1 mojitos!"
}

if (time < 12) {
  var meal = "breakfast";
} else if (time < 15 && time > 12) {
  var meal = "lunch";
} else if (time < 22 && time > 15) {
  var meal = "dinner";
}

console.log(meal);
console.log(dailySpecials[meal]);
console.log(restaurantOne);

// Now practice accessing properties and printing them to the console. Print the main dishes using dot notation
// console.log(restaurantOne.mainDishes[0]);

// Now print the seating capacity using dot notation
// console.log(restaurantOne.seatingCapacity);

// Print the main dishes again using bracket notation
console.log(restaurantOne['mainDishes']);

// Print the seating capacity again using bracket notation
console.log(restaurantOne['seatingCapacity']);

// Let's make another object to illustrate one advantage of using bracket over dot notation. Start by creating a new object called dailySpecials and write out the keys breakfast, lunch, and dinner. The values should be statements about the specials (i.e. "15% off breakfast").

//Now create a conditional statement that equates the word meal to each one of your keys depending on the time of day

//Make a variable called time. Use bracket notation to pull to display the current special.



// Does it work with dot notation? Try it out!


// Let's go back to our restaurants object and add appetizers and desserts to it using two different methods
restaurantOne["desserts"] = ["hot sundae", "apple pie"];
console.log(restaurantOne);
restaurantOne.appetizers = ["french fries", "salad", "mojito"];


// The food items have changed a bit because it is now summer! Use the same methods used to add an item, to edit some of the items in your entree, appetizer, and desserts
restaurantOne["desserts"] = restaurantOne.desserts.concat(["strawberry pie"]);
restaurantOne.appetizers = ["onion rings", "french fries"];


// Let's now create methods that just print out a string when the restaurant opens or closes. Create a method called openRestaurant and closeRestaurant inside of the restaurant object

//Now call on these two methods
console.log(restaurantOne.closeRestaurant());


// Let's practice using the 'this' keyword. Create another restaurant object.
let restaurantTwo = {
  name: "McDonalds",
  restaurantOnFire: false,
  openRestaurant() {
    if(this.restaurantOnFire) {
      return "WE ARE ON FIRE! Close premises";
    } else {
      return `${this.name} is open for business!`;
    }
  }
};

console.log(restaurantTwo.openRestaurant());
// restaurantOne.openRestaurant = restaurantTwo.openRestaurant;
console.log(restaurantOne.openRestaurant());

// Add a key to your restaurants object called restaurantOnFire and set the boolean to false (hopefully by default there is no fire!)

// Show the other way of using this - adds flexibility and allows the method to be used in other objects


// Finally let's do some while/for loops on our restaurants to print out the entrees

let item = 0;
while (item < restaurantOne.mainDishes.length) {
  console.log(restaurantOne.mainDishes[item]);
  item++;
}

for (let item in restaurantOne) {
  console.log(restaurantOne[item]);
}
