### CSS Meia Queries

Media queries are useful when you want to modify your site or app
depending on a device's general type (such as print vs. screen) or
specific characteristics and parameters (such as screen resolution or
browser viewport width).

```
@media screen and (min-width: 900px) {
    body {
        font-size: 30px;
    }
}
```
