// Use a while loop to print out the even numbers from 0 to a maximum number that you set in the console. 
// YOUR CODE HERE  
  
//Use a do...while loop to print the numbers 1 to 10 on your html file (using .innerHTML....)
// YOUR CODE HERE
  
// Write a JavaScript program which iterates the integers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print "Happy" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Sad". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "HappySad". (Hint - This will use a while loop containing conditional statements together)
// YOUR CODE HERE  
  
  
/* Write a JavaScript program to construct the following pattern, using a nested for loop.

/* In this exercise, you will use a bit of HTML and JS together. 
1) Make some radio buttons with at least five different colors (ex: blue, yellow. red)
2) Use a switch statement that triggers an alert: when one clicks on one of the radio buttons an alert pops up saying various statements like "That is the color of sky!" and "My favorite color is yellow!" (depending on the color picked)
Hint - use an 'onclick' event handler in each radio button calling on a function containing the switch statement
