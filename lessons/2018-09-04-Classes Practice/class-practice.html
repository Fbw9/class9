// PROBLEM 1: Write a JavaScript program to get the volume of a Cylinder with four decimal places using object classes.

// Volume of a cylinder : V = Ï€r2h
// where r is the radius and h is the height of the cylinder.



// PROBLEM 2:
// A) Create a class called Song() with two properties:
//     > songName - i.e., 'A day in the Life'
//     > bandName - i.e., 'The Beatles'
// B) create a new instance of the class, storing it in a variable
// C) Add two methods to the class:
//     > countName - return the total number of words in the song name
//     > createElement - create a new DOM element
// D) Create an instance with the new keyword
// E) Append the instance to the DOM


// PROBLEM 3:

function Dog (name) {
  this.name = name
}
Dog.bark = function () {
  console.log(this.name + ' says woof')
}
let fido = new Dog('fido')
fido.bark()

//QUESTION: I WANT MY DOG TO BARK. But it isn't :( Can you explain why it isn't?
// TASK: Fix this using two methods we learned (i.e. classes and older syntax prototypes)


//PROBLEM 4:
//A)Create a class called employee with properties of first and last names and a method getName which prints out the full name.
//B)Next, create a subclass called manager which inherits the same properties from employee and then adds an additional property called managedEmployees which will be set to a blank array.
// C) Finally, create a method for manager called addEmployee which takes one argument, employee, and when called adds an employee to the managedEmployees array.
// D) Bonus create a calculateAge method to employee like we did in class (you will have to add additional properties, too)
