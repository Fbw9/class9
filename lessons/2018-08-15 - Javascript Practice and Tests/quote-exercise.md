# Random Quotes

## Exercise

Create a random quote generator, that uses quotes that are stored in an array.  
There's a default array in the template, to help if you don't know good quotes.

__You have to create:__

- A function that generate a random number in a given range
- A function _getQuote()_ that 
    - gets a random number that's not higher than the amount of quotes
    - gets the quote with that number
    - updates the displayed blockquote

## Mockup

Your result could look like the following demo, that shows all needed parts of the application. Feel free to add some more creative styling, but please get it working first.
